# docConverter

* Initialized the first Document Converter, file will be updated progressively.

## Introduction

The General architecture has been created,Java is the main language for coding. Maven is choosen as a tech stack to have a control over the dependencies and versions. 



## Arcihtecture

Each class is doing one transformation for the related context, for example (pdf-docx).

For several purposes, some of these transformations are more complicated than eachother. Therefore, we need to use different libraries, frameworks and dependencies which makes the process complicated but enough to get results.

The input files structure is important for the performance of the algorithm, most of the libraries support basic transformation but for a complicated transformations, cheap licensing might be considered.

Any feedback or improvement suggestions will be higlhy appreciated.

The general libary stack not limited but:

* Apachi POI

* Docx4j
